# Amazon Clone using React

## Overview

The **Amazon Clone** is a React-based web application that replicates the core functionality of the Amazon e-commerce platform. It allows users to browse products, search for items, add them to a cart, and proceed through a checkout process. The app also features user authentication for personalized experiences.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and logout functionality using Firebase or a custom backend.
- **Product Listings**: Dynamic display of products with search filters like category, price, etc.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update items in the cart with real-time price calculation.
- **Checkout Process**: Step-by-step process including order summary, shipping details, and payment options.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase (Optional)**: For authentication and database services.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the components and responsive layout.
- **Axios/Fetch**: For making API requests (e.g., product data).

## Firebase Setup 

If you're using Firebase for authentication and database:

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Copy your Firebase configuration into a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
   REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   ```
3. Integrate Firebase into your project using `firebase` npm package.

## Usage

- **Sign Up / Login**: Users can create accounts or log in to access their personalized shopping experience.
